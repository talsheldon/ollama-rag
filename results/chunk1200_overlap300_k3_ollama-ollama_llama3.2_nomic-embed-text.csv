What is Apache Iceberg? Explain in short.,"Apache Iceberg is an open-source storage format for big data, designed to provide efficient and scalable data management capabilities. It allows for flexible partitioning and sorting of data, enabling improved data management, serialization isolation, and cost-based optimization. Iceberg supports various features such as default value support, multi-argument transforms, row lineage tracking, and table encryption keys. Its goal is to enable reads to be isolated from concurrent writes, reducing the risk of data corruption, while also improving read performance and scalability.",11.81,[To be evaluated],llama3.2,nomic-embed-text,Chroma,None (in-memory),1200,300,3,basic,Yes,175,476.2,14.81
How does Iceberg ensure that two writers do not overwrite each others ingestion results?,"According to the specification, Iceberg uses a ""disjoint ID range"" approach to ensure that two writers do not overwrite each other's ingestion results. When a new snapshot is created in a different branch, it assigns a disjoint ID range to existing data files based on the table's next-row-id when the snapshot is committed.

This means that even if multiple writers are writing to the same table at the same time, they will use different IDs for their data files, preventing overwriting. Additionally, Iceberg also uses sequence numbers to track the relative age of data and delete files, which helps to prevent stale or outdated data from being overwritten.",14.69,[To be evaluated],llama3.2,nomic-embed-text,Chroma,None (in-memory),1200,300,3,basic,Yes,175,476.2,14.81
How to access data that was deleted in a newer snapshot?,"To access data that was deleted in a newer snapshot, you can use the deletion vectors or position delete records.

Deletion Vectors:

* Deletion vectors identify deleted rows of a file by encoding deleted positions in a bitmap.
* A set bit at position P indicates that the row at position P is deleted.
* Deletion vectors are stored using the deletion-vector-v1 blob definition from the Puffin spec.

Position Delete Records:

* Position delete records track deleted rows of a file by storing the positions of deleted rows.
* These records can be used to reconstruct a stream of changes to a table.

To access data that was deleted in a newer snapshot, you can use these deletion vectors or position delete records. The exact process will depend on the specifics of your use case and the version of Apache Iceberg you are using.

Here is an example of how you might use these records:

1. Get the latest manifest for the file you are interested in.
2. Check if there are any deleted rows in the manifest. If so, check the deletion vectors or position delete records to determine which rows were deleted and where they were located.
3. Use the location information from the deletion vectors or position delete records to access the data that was previously stored at those locations.

It's worth noting that Apache Iceberg also supports point-in-time reads, which allow you to read data at a specific timestamp. If you need to access data that was deleted in a newer snapshot, you may be able to use this feature to get the latest version of the data before it was deleted.",19.6,[To be evaluated],llama3.2,nomic-embed-text,Chroma,None (in-memory),1200,300,3,basic,Yes,175,476.2,14.81
What happens if a writer attempts to commit based on an old snapshot?,"If a writer attempts to commit based on an old snapshot, it means that the writer is trying to use a snapshot that has already been expired from the list of valid snapshots. In this case, all entries before the expired snapshot should be removed from the metadata log.

According to the specification, if a writer attempts to commit based on an old snapshot, the resulting snapshot will not be considered valid, and any data written to it will eventually become garbage collected.",13.13,[To be evaluated],llama3.2,nomic-embed-text,Chroma,None (in-memory),1200,300,3,basic,Yes,175,476.2,14.81
